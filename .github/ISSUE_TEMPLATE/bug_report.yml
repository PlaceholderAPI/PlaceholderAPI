      Thank you for taking your time and opening a Bug Report.
      In order for us to process this Bug Report as fast and efficient as possible do we ask you to read the form carefully and provide any requested information.
      Required fields are marked with an asterisk symbol (`*`)
      
      Also, always make sure to use the latest Release from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/6245/) or the latest Development Build from our [Jenkins Server](http://ci.extendedclip.com/job/PlaceholderAPI/) to make sure that your issue isn't already fixed.
