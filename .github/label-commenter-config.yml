          The issue you encounter is not considered a bug and rather an intentional behaviour of PlaceholderAPI and/or one of its expansions.
          If you still believe that it is a bug, provide more information and a maintainer of this repository may look at it more closely.
          
          Before providing more info, always make sure to use the latest version of PlaceholderAPI, as the issue you encounter might already be fixed in a newer version.
          Optionally can you also try out [development builds](https://ci.extendedclip.com/job/PlaceholderAPI/) and see if the issue was fixed there.
