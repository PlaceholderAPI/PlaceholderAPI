# Information 
[PlaceholderAPI][spigot] is a plugin for Spigot servers that allows server owners to display information from various plugins with a uniform format. 

Support for specific plugins are provided either by the plugin itself or through expansions. The expansions may be downloaded in-game through the PAPI Expansion Cloud. There are currently over 240+ expansions that support a wide variety of plugins, such as Essentials, Factions, LuckPerms, and Vault. 

PlaceholderAPI has been downloaded over 1,000,000 times and has been used concurrently on over 40,000 servers, which makes it a must-have for a server of any type or scale.
